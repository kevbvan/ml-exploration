## Exploration - The action of traveling in or through an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it.

This repository is for all of my learning and exploration of new and old topics. Whether it be a library 
of resources from past coding projects from school or independent learning to stay in shape, this place will
contain my notes, findings, and comments about topics learned.
