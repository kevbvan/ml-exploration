# Sentiment Analysis

In this exploration, I took a data of over 50,000 Amazon reviews and classified whether them on whether they were positive or negative.

Libraries used: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NLTK

Due to the size contraint of Git, I am unable to upload all the data but will instead use screenshots to illustrate my findings.
